x=5     # in memory when we define mermory define 3 thing
        #   type -> integer
        #   value -> 5
        #   refrence count -> 1 // means only one variable is pting to 5 i.e why refrence count 1

# to prrint adress of x where this 5 is stored in memory or indirectly say adress where 5 is stored in memory

print(id(x))  # will get adress

# now suppose y = 5  refrence count will reach 2; and if we do id(y) adress would be same as it is adress of 5 not x or y

# starting of a variable should either be character or underscore can not start by number

# variables are case sensitive name and Name are two differnt variables..

# reserve words are for if and many more..
